## Introduction

Echocardiography plays a vital role in assessing cardiac function and diagnosing heart diseases. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle is crucial for quantifying cardiac parameters. Echo-DND leverages a dual noise diffusion model to enhance segmentation performance, addressing challenges such as noise and variability in echocardiographic images.

## Features

- **Robust Segmentation**: Achieve high accuracy in left ventricle segmentation.
- **Noise Resilience**: Effectively handle noise in echocardiographic videos.
- **Deep Learning Framework**: Built on state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple interface for researchers and clinicians.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides for installation and usage.

## Installation

To install Echo-DND, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nassersaber/Echo-DND.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Echo-DND
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can use Echo-DND for segmenting echocardiographic images. Hereâ€™s a quick guide on how to run the model:

1. Prepare your input images or videos.
2. Run the segmentation script:

   ```bash
   python segment.py --input <path_to_input> --output <path_to_output>
   ```

3. Check the output directory for segmented images.

## Dataset

For training and evaluation, you can use publicly available echocardiographic datasets. We recommend the following sources:

- **Cleveland Clinic Foundation Database**: Contains a variety of echocardiographic images.
- **CAMUS Dataset**: Focused on cardiac segmentation tasks.

Ensure that you preprocess the images as required by the model.

## Training

To train the Echo-DND model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset and organize it into training and validation sets.
2. Modify the configuration file to specify paths and parameters.
3. Run the training script:

   ```bash
   python train.py --config <path_to_config>
   ```

4. Monitor training progress and evaluate performance on the validation set.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the trained model, use the evaluation script:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model <path_to_model> --dataset <path_to_dataset>
```

This will provide metrics such as Dice coefficient and Intersection over Union (IoU) for assessing segmentation quality.

## Results

Echo-DND has shown promising results in segmenting the left ventricle from echocardiographic images. Below are some examples of segmentation results:
